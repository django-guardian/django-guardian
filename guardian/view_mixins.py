class LoginRequiredMixin(object):
    """ 
    A login required mixin for use with class based views. This Class is a light wrapper around the
    `login_required` decorator and hence function parameters are just attributes defined on the class.
    
    Due to parent class order traversal this mixin must be added as the left most 
    mixin of a view.
    
    The mixin has exaclty the same flow as `login_required` decorator:
    
        If the user isn't logged in, redirect to settings.LOGIN_URL, passing the current 
        absolute path in the query string. Example: /accounts/login/?next=/polls/3/.
        
        If the user is logged in, execute the view normally. The view code is free to 
        assume the user is logged in.

    **Class Settings**
        `redirect_field_name - defaults to "next"
        `login_url` - the login url of your site
        
    """

class PermissionRequiredMixin(object):
    """ 
    A view mixin that verifies if the current logged in user has the specified permission 
    by wrapping the ``request.user.has_perm(..)`` method.
     
    If a `get_object()` method is defined either manually or by including another mixin (for example
    ``SingleObjectMixin``) or ``self.object`` is defiend then the permission will be tested against 
    that specific instance.
    
    .. NOTE: Testing of a permission against a specific object instance requires an authentication backend
             that supports. Please see ``django-guardian`` to add object level permissions to your project.  
    
    The mixin does the following:  
    
        If the user isn't logged in, redirect to settings.LOGIN_URL, passing the current 
        absolute path in the query string. Example: /accounts/login/?next=/polls/3/.
            
        If the `raise_exception` is set to True than rather than redirect to login page
        a `PermisionDenied` (403) is raised.
        
        If the user is logged in, and passes the permission check than the view is executed
        normally.

    **Example Usage**
