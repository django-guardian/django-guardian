.. important::
    In this release we have removed undocumented ``get_for_object`` method

    ``GroupObjectPermissionManager``. Not deprecated, removed. Those methods
    were not used within ``django-guardian`` and their odd names could lead to
    issues if user would believe they would return object level permissions
    associated with user/group and object passed as the input. If you depend
    on those methods, you'd need to stick with version 1.1 and make sure you
    do not misuse them.
