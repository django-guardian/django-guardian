# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Due to limited resources, only the latest version of django-guardian will be supported with security updates; we won't do patch updates to prior minor versions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do NOT describe issues which may indicate vulnerabilities or demonstrate possible exploits in an issue, which will be public. 
Instead, please prepare a demo and description of the explout and contact @thclark or one of the other maintainers directly.

## How we manage vulnerabilities

If we agree that a vulnerability exists, we'll use GitHub's security settings to publish an advisory whilst issuing a release to fix the problem.
