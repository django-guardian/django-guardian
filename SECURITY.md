# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Due to limited resources, only the latest version of django-guardian will be supported with security updates (ie we won't do patch updates to prior minor versions).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do NOT describe issues which may indicate vulnerabilities or demonstrate possible exploits in an issue, which will be public.

Instead, please prepare a demo and description of the explout and visit the [security tab on the repository](https://github.com/django-guardian/django-guardian/security) to report an issue confidentially.

## How we manage vulnerabilities

Th emaintainers will review the vulnerability, and use GitHub's security settings to publish an advisory whilst issuing a release to fix the problem.
