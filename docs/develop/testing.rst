Testing
=======

Introduction
------------

``django-guardian`` is extending capabilities of Django's authorization
facilities and as so, it changes it's security somehow. It is extremaly
important to provide as simplest :ref:`api` as possible.

According to OWASP_, `broken authentication
<http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2010-A3>`_ is one of most commonly
security issue exposed in web applications.

Having this on mind we tried to build small set of necessary functions and
created a lot of testing scenarios. Nevertheless, if anyone would found a bug in
this application, please take a minute and file it at `issue-tracker`_.
Moreover, if someone would spot a *security hole* (a bug that might affect
security of systems that use ``django-guardian`` as permission management
library), please **DO NOT** create a public issue but contact me directly
(lukaszbalcerzak@gmail.com).


Running tests
-------------

Tests are run by Django's buildin test runner. To call it simply run::

    $ python setup.py test

or inside a project with ``guardian`` set at ``INSTALLED_APPS``::

    $ python manage.py test guardian

or using the bundled ``testapp`` project::

    $ python manage.py test

Coverage support
----------------

Coverage_ is a tool for measuring code coverage of Python programs. It is great
for tests and we use it as a backup - we try to cover 100% of the code used by
``django-guardian``. This of course does *NOT* mean that if all of the codebase
is covered by tests we can be sure there is no bug (as specification of almost
all applications requries some unique scenarios to be tested). On the other hand
it definitely helps to track missing parts.

To run tests with coverage_ support and show the report after we have provided
simple bash script which can by called by running::

    $ ./run_test_and_report.sh


Result should be somehow similar to following::

Tox
---

.. versionadded:: 1.0.4

We also started using tox_ to ensure ``django-guardian``'s tests would pass on
all supported Python and Django versions (see :ref:`supported-versions`). To
use it, simply install ``tox``::

    pip install tox

and run it within ``django-guardian`` checkout directory::

    tox

First time should take some time (it needs to create separate virtual
environments and pull dependencies) but would ensure everything is fine.


Travis CI
---------

.. versionadded:: 1.0.4

.. image:: https://secure.travis-ci.org/django-guardian/django-guardian.png?branch=master
  :target: http://travis-ci.org/django-guardian/django-guardian

Recently we have added support for Travis_, continuous integration server so it
is even more easy to follow if test fails with new commits: http://travis-ci.org/#!/lukaszb/django-guardian.
