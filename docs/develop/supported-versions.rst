Supported versions
==================

``django-guardian`` supports Python 2.7+/3.3+ and Django 1.11+.

Rules
-----

* We would support Python 2.7. We also support Python 3.4+.
* Support for Python 3.4 may get dropped in the future.
* We support Django 1.11+. This is due to many simplifications in code we could
  do.
