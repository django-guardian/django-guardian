# Installation

This application requires [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/) 3.2 or
higher and it is the only prerequisite before `django-guardian` may be
used.

In order to install `django-guardian` simply use `pip`:

    pip install django-guardian

This would be enough to run `django-guardian`. However, in order to run
tests or example application, there are some other requirements. See
more details about the topics:

-   `Testing <testing>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
-   `Example project <example-project>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
