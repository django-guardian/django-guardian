Installation
============

This application requires Django_ 2.1 or higher and it is the only prerequisite
before ``django-guardian`` may be used.

In order to install ``django-guardian`` simply use ``pip``::

   pip install django-guardian

This would be enough to run ``django-guardian``. However, in order to run tests
or example application, there are some other requirements. See more
details about the topics:
